# Authentication

You can read a quickstart guide for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/webapi-owin/01-authorization).

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Make sure `web.config` contains your credentials. You can find your credentials in the settings section of your Auth0 Client.
2. Hit F5 to start local web development server.

Go to `http://localhost:58105/api/ping` and you'll see the app running :).
